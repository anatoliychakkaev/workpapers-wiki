:!: Looks like you haven't created the main sidebar yet. Do it now by creating the following page: LINK

Once you've created the page, just add an unordered list of links to create the navigation i.e.:

<file>  
* [[link 1]]
* [[link 2]]
* [[link 3]]
</file>

You can also use one of the many available index [[doku>plugins]]. 

For further information about sidebars refer to the template [[doku>template:arctic#first steps|documenation]].
